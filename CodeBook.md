#Tidy Data Set CodeBook
This codebook will describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

##Data Source
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Here are the data for the project:

##Dataset description
The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

* 'features.txt': List of all features.

* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

###Train Dataset

* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

###Test Dataset

* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

* â€˜test/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
